 the morning before that.  For example:

 "P1W" for "1 week."  The strings are in ISO 8601 format.  This method uses the

 If expirationPeriod is nil, returns nil, indicating that there is no
 expiration period for that date.  (Note that for repeating schedules, a task
 will always expire at the next repetition of that schedule -- unless that
 schedule's "expires" property says it should expire sooner.)  If
 expirationPeriod is not nil, adds expirationPeriod to date.  For example:
